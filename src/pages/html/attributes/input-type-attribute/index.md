## Input Type Attribute
The HTML ``<input>`` element is used to create controls in HTML forms that allow data to be collected from users or visitors to your site. One of the attributes that is allowed to go into the ``<input>`` element is the ``type`` attribute. The ``type``	 attribute determines how the ``<input>`` element works or is rendered by the browser. 
The values that the ``type`` attribute can take are:

 1. text - An input field for entering single line text. If no ``type`` attribute is declared for an ``<input>`` element, it defaults to a text field
 1. button - A button with no default behaviour.
 2. checkbox - A checkbox control that allows values to be selected or unselected.
 3. radio - A radio control that allows only one option to be selected amongst multiple choices.
 4. color - A control that shows a color picker when it is selected. Once a desired color is selected, the HEX code of the corresponding color is automatically pasted into the input control. 
 5. date - A control for entering the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
 6. datetime-local - A control for entering the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and time in the format HH:MM:SS
 7. month - A control for entering a month and a year
 8. time - A control for entering a time value in the format HH:MM SS
 9. week - A control for entering a week-year number and year in the format WW-YYYY
 8. email - An input field for entering email addresses. Anytime an email address is entered, and the form is submitted, the browser ensures that a valid email address was entered.
 9. url - An input field for entering URLs e.g. http://www.freecodecamp.org Anytime a url is entered, and the form is submitted, the browser ensures that a valid url was entered.
 9. file - A control that allows your user to upload files e.g. a profile picture or a Resume in pdf format 
 10. number - A form control for entering a number
 11. reset - A button that when clicked resets all the form controls to their initial state. 
 12. range - A form control that is rendered as a slider. It allows you to choose a number between a stated maximum and minimum value. 
 13. password - An input field in which the text that is entered is obscured from view. It is used for example to get passwords from users on login pages. 
 14. search - An input field for entering search strings. 
 15. tel - An input field for entering telephone numbers
 16. submit - A button that when clicked submits the form. 

It should be noted that based on browser differences, these form controls may render differently in different web browsers. CSS styling can be used to ensure that they are rendered uniformly across all web browsers.
